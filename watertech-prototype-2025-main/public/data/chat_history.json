The current EC level is 0.85 dS/m, which is slightly elevated but still acceptable for tomatoes. For best results, I recommend irrigating in the early morning and applying 10-15% extra water for leaching salts from the root zone.",

This will help displace excess sodium from soil particles and improve soil structure. Apply the gypsum before your next irrigation for best results, and irrigate thoroughly afterward to help it penetrate the soil profile.",

      "message": "Yes, using the well water directly in your drip irrigation system poses a high clogging risk. The water has high iron content (2.1 mg/L) which exceeds the safe threshold of 0.2 mg/L for drip systems. I recommend installing a sand media filtration system with chlorine injection to precipitate and filter out the iron. Alternatively, you could aerate the water in a holding tank before filtration to oxidize the iron for easier removal.",

Based on current measurements, I suggest mixing 2 parts canal water (EC: 0.85 dS/m) with 1 part well water (EC: 3.24 dS/m). This would result in a mixed water EC of approximately 1.65 dS/m, which is acceptable for most of your crops including cotton and wheat.
